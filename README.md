## Searching

### [Linear Search](searching/linear.go)

Linear search or sequential search sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

* Worst-case performance O(n)
* Best-case performance O(1)
* Average performance O(n/2)

### [Binary Search](searching/binary_1.go)

Binary search finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

* The search process initiates by locating the middle element of the sorted array of data
* After that, the key value is compared with the element
* If the key value is smaller than the middle element, then searches analyses the upper values to the middle element for comparison and matching
* In case the key value is greater than the middle element then searches analyses the lower values to the middle element for comparison and matching

Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in two ways:
1. [Iterative Method](searching/binary_2.go)
1. [Recursive Method](searching/binary_3.go)

* Worst-case performance O(log n)
* Best-case performance O(1)
* Average performance O(log n)
